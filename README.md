Average Score

📈 1. Chart 1: Distribution of Average Scores

This histogram shows how students are performing overall.

Insights

Most students score between 65 and 75.

Very few students score below 55, indicating overall good performance.

A small group reaches 80+, showing high performers.

📉 2. Chart 2: Study Hours vs Average Score (Scatter Plot)

This scatter plot shows the relationship between study hours and performance.

Insights

There is a mild positive correlation: Students who study more tend to score higher.

Some students study less but score high → these may be naturally strong or efficient learners.

A few students study more than 5 hours but do not score very high → indicates less effective study methods.

📘 Summary of Findings
⭐ Key Observations

Overall performance is good, with most students clustering in the 65–75 range.

Study hours influence performance, but not perfectly — quality may matter more than quantity.

Science scores are slightly higher on average than Math and English (from dataset generation).

The dataset shows natural variation in student abilities and study habits.
